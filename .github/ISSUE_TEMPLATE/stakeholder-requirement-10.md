**As a**  stakeholder
 **I need** to suggest the team opt for the automation to deploy the new changes to the cloud
 **So that** the deployment can be smooth and contains less bugs
   
 ### Details and Assumptions

Automation to deploy the new changes to the cloud is a better way to deploy the new changes to the cloud so that a lot of time can be saved by cutting down all the repetitive tasks and also attaining accuracy. 
   
 ### Acceptance Criteria  
   
 ```gherkin
 Given a new changes to the product
 When the product/changes is ready to be deployed 
 Then it can be done through automation
 ```
